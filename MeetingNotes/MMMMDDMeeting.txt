Should a player object contain a currSpace entity or should the space contain a list of players on it?
    Chris - I'm thinking the player should have a space

How to handle multiple meebles on one space?
  Draw position offset from center space?
  Display toplayer meeble (i.e. currPlayer or another way)


If you only use the bool isHuman in the player class, how are you planning to tell player 1 from player 2 apart?
  Subclasses of Player (P_Human and P_Computer)?
